## üéØ Problem Statement

Event organizers today face a fragmented ecosystem of tools, leaving them juggling between:
- Desktop-only management systems requiring constant computer access
- Disconnected analytics that don't provide real-time insights
- Separate platforms for ticket sales and attendee engagement
- Limited mobile control, forcing organizers to be tethered to laptops during events

This creates unnecessary complexity precisely when organizers need simplicity - during the high-stress environment of live event management.

Tickease is a mobile-first, comprehensive event management platform that unifies the entire event lifecycle from creation to analytics in a single, powerful application. We've built a system that allows organizers to create, manage, and monitor events entirely from their mobile devices.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technical Deep Dive

### Real-time Attendee Tracking
Our innovative dual-database approach enables true real-time monitoring of event attendance:

```typescript
// Live attendee tracking using Firebase Realtime Database
export function useEventUserCount(eventId: string | null) {
  const [userCount, setUserCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!eventId) {
      setUserCount(0);
      return;
    }

    // Reference to the event's attendees
    const eventAttendeesRef = ref(database, `events/${eventId}/attendees`);
    
    // Set up listener for attendees
    const unsubscribe = onValue(eventAttendeesRef, (snapshot) => {
      if (!snapshot.exists()) {
        setUserCount(0);
        return;
      }
      
      // Count active users in this event
      let count = 0;
      snapshot.forEach((childSnapshot) => {
        const userData = childSnapshot.val();
        if (userData && userData.active === true) {
          count++;
        }
      });
      
      setUserCount(count);
    });
    
    // Clean up the listener when component unmounts or eventId changes
    return () => unsubscribe();
